```

#### Search & Filter:
```php
search($keyword, $limit)              // Search by name/description

```

#### Stock Management:
```php
updateStock($id, $qty)                // Add/subtract stock

## 💡 Code Examples

### Using Product Model:
```php
// Create product
$productId = $productModel->create([
    'name' => 'Galon Air Minum 19L',
    'description' => 'Air minum berkualitas',
    'price' => 25000,
    'stock' => 50,
    'category' => 'Air Minum',
    'image' => 'product_123.jpg'
]);

// Get all products with pagination
$products = $productModel->getAll('Air Minum', 10, 0);

// Search products
$results = $productModel->search('galon', 20);

// Update stock
$productModel->updateStock(5, -3); // Reduce by 3

// Check stock
if ($productModel->hasStock(5, 10)) {
    // Has sufficient stock
}
```

### Admin Protection:
```php
class AdminController extends BaseController
{
    public function someMethod()
    {
        // This will redirect to login if not admin
        $this->requireAuth('admin');
        
        // Admin-only code here
    }
}
```
